## Troubleshooting

If something doesn‚Äôt work:

1. Make sure you‚Äôre inside a virtual environment (`python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`).
2. Run `pip install -e .` again after changes.
3. Check that your SQLite database (`tests.db`) exists ‚Äî the app should create it automatically.
4. Open an issue or email me at [belammuia0@gmail.com](mailto:belammuia0@gmail.com).
